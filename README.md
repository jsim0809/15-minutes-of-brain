# Brain15

A simple app to solve a complex social need. Currently hosted at brain.jeremysim.com.

## Design objectives

Studies show that decision fatigue is a constant factor in our lives today, particularly in the evenings when we're deciding what to do with our free time. This leads to a lot of wasted hours â€” we're literally too tired to know what to do.

Brain15 is designed to fill those gaps with growth and learning. Hit the button to bring up a random video from our user-curated database, and enjoy. All videos are between 4 and 20 minutes long.

## Engineering objectives

Brain15 is a random educational resource fetcher. It fetches educational resources -- Youtube videos, for example -- at the click of a button, removing decision energy from the equation. It utilizes the Youtube API to do so, and keeps track of a user's likes and dislikes into a PostgreSQL database. Over time, a user's preferences should improve both their individual video quality and the quality of the overall app.

## Next steps

If you would like to contribute to this project, next steps are:
- User authentication
- Database seeding
- Server-side rendering
- Fetch algorithm improvement
